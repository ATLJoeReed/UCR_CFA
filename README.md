# UCR_CFA
Uniform Crime Reporting Project for CFA


This project involves grabbing data from as many police directories that we can, merging them into a single file of unique agencies across the use, and then matching them to the FBI data. The end goal is a data set that clearly outlines who reports and who doesn't to aid in the decision making for a wide variety of parties including legislators, researchers, reporters, individuals, and even the agencies themselves.

We hope to produce this for free and accessible use, along with a tool for easily searching and viewing the data for consumption and dissemination.
