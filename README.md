Uniform Crime Reporting Project in collaboration with Code for Atlanta (a brigade of Code for America). 


This project involves grabbing data from as many police directories that we can, merging them into a single file of unique agencies across the use, and then matching them to the FBI data. The end goal is a data set that clearly outlines who reports and who doesn't to aid in the decision making for a wide variety of parties including legislators, researchers, reporters, individuals, and even the agencies themselves.

We hope to produce this for free and accessible use, along with a tool for easily searching and viewing the data for consumption and dissemination. 

Many users are responsible for this data which is in active development. We encourage all individuals interested in transparency and open data to reach out or take an active role in their community!

It is important to remember that submitting data to the FBI is a difficult and beauracratic process and is unfeasible to a wide swath of american police agencies. We make no assumptions about the nature of missing data and do not wish to pass judgement or imply wrongdoing on those agencies that choose not to. We simply want to deepend the conversation and understanding about the nature of reporting in the US and to that extent we believe this to be a worthy effort. 

#Remember, with great data comes great responsibility! 
It is against the spirit of open data to misuse or misrepresent the data given here. If you would like help interpreting this data please reach out before making assumptions. There exists considerable nuance in the FBI reporting data, in particular the FBI wishes all to caution against "ranking" crime.
